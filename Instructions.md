# HackerRank Orchestrate

Repository for the **HackerRank Orchestrate** 24-hour hackathon (May 1–2, 2026).

Build a terminal-based AI agent that triages real support tickets across three product ecosystems; **HackerRank**, **Claude**, and **Visa** - using only the support corpus shipped in this repo.

## What you need to build

A terminal-based agent that, for each row in `support_tickets/support_tickets.csv`, produces:

| Column         | Allowed values                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`       | `replied`, `escalated`                                  |
| `product_area` | most relevant support category / domain area            |
| `response`     | user-facing answer grounded in the provided corpus      |
| `justification`| concise explanation of the routing/answering decision   |
| `request_type` | `product_issue`, `feature_request`, `bug`, `invalid`    |

Hard requirements (from `problem_statement.md`):

- Must be **terminal-based**.
- Must use **only the provided support corpus** (no live web calls for ground-truth answers).
- Must **escalate** high-risk, sensitive, or unsupported cases instead of guessing.
- Must avoid hallucinated policies or unsupported claims.

Beyond that you are free to bring your own approach — RAG, vector DBs, tool use, structured output, agent frameworks, classical ML, or anything else.

## Where your code goes

All of your work belongs in [`code/`](./code/). The repo ships with an empty `code/main.py` you can grow into your full agent — add more modules (`agent.py`, `retriever.py`, `classifier.py`, etc.) next to it as needed.

Conventions:

- Put a **README inside `code/`** describing how to install dependencies and run your agent.
- Read secrets **from environment variables only** (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, …). Copy `.env.example` → `.env` (already gitignored) if you keep one. **Never hardcode keys.**
- Be **deterministic** where possible. Seed any random sampling.
- Write responses to `support_tickets/output.csv`.

## Chat transcript logging

This repo ships with an `AGENTS.md` that any modern AI coding tool (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot, etc.) will read. It instructs the tool to append every conversation turn to a single shared log file:

| Platform       | Path                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS / Linux  | `$HOME/hackerrank_orchestrate/log.txt`            |
| Windows        | `%USERPROFILE%\hackerrank_orchestrate\log.txt`    |

You don't need to do anything to enable it — just use your AI tool normally. You'll upload this `log.txt` as your chat transcript at submission time.

## Submission

Submit on the HackerRank Community Platform:
<https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/hackerrank-orchestrate-may26/challenges/support-agent/submission>

You will upload **three** files:

1. **Code zip** — zip your `code/` directory and upload it. Exclude virtualenvs, `node_modules`, build artifacts, the `data/` corpus, and the `support_tickets/` CSVs.
2. **Predictions CSV** — your agent's output for `support_tickets/support_tickets.csv` (i.e. the populated `output.csv`).
3. **Chat transcript** — the `log.txt` from the path in [Chat transcript logging](#chat-transcript-logging).
